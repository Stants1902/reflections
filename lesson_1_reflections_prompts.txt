How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced

It showed me what the differences were between the versions, allowing me to easily see changes that had been made

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

It helps me see changes that have been made to the file, who made it, and when it was made. This could help me as I can help others and at the same time
learn from others when they change the version. It also lets me go back if I make any mistakes.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

Pro's -

Not too many versions, autosave can lead to increased number of versios making it difficult to track changes
Versions only created when you want, so changes make more sense

Cons
Need to remember to commit when made logical changes, or it could be confusing if you commit a change that is too big
